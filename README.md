# buildspace-clone

## Description

I found this site pretty randomly but really liked the scrolling images animation that was happening on the hero page. What transpired was me trying to figure out how to implement this animation, along with making it responsive.

The responsiveness of the site also changes the direction and placement of the sliding images.

- Desktop: Slider on right side of page vertically
- Tablet: Slider below hero text, moving horizontally

This was a good challenge that allowed me to tap into using CSS Grid, keyframes and media queries to create a neat clone of this website.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS (both style and animation)
